[//]: # (title: KMM plugin releases)
[//]: # (auxiliary-id: KMM_plugin_releases)

Since KMM is now in [Alpha](kmm-evolution.md), we are working on stabilizing the [KMM plugin for Android Studio](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile) 
and will be regularly releasing new versions that include new features, improvements, and bug fixes. 

Ensure that you have the latest version of the KMM plugin!

## Update to the new release

Android Studio will suggest updating to a new KMM plugin release as soon as it is available. If you accept the suggestion, it will automatically update the KMM plugin to the latest version. 
Youâ€™ll need to restart Android Studio to complete the plugin installation.

You can check the KMM plugin version and update the plugin manually in **Preferences** | **Plugins**.

You need a compatible version of Kotlin for the KMM plugin to work correctly. You can find compatible versions in the [release details](#release-details).
You can check your Kotlin version and update it in **Preferences** | **Plugins** or in **Tools** | **Kotlin** | **Configure Plugin Updates**.

>If you do not have a compatible version of Kotlin installed, the KMM plugin will be disabled. You will need to update your Kotlin 
>version, and then enable the KMM plugin in **Preferences** | **Plugins**.
